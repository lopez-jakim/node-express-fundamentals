### thing to remember:
#### Rate Limiting:
- way to control how often someone can do something on a website or app.
    - for example:
        - how many should the users refresh the page.
        - make a request to an API.
        - try to log in.
- rate limiting help with the following:
    - preventing abuse (e.g., stopping someone from making 1000 login attempts in a minute)
    - only 100 request per user every 15 minutes
- 429 http code = too many requests
